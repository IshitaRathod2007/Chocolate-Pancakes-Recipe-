                      Instructions
 1) In a food processor, add all ingredients for the pancakes and process until combined and smooth. Let batter stand for 5-10 minutes. Then, process again for about 30 seconds.

 2) Heat up a non-stick skillet over low heat. Spoon a ladleful of batter onto skillet, and cook for 1-2 minutes before flipping and cooking the other side for 1 minute. Repeat until you use up all the batter.

 3) While waiting for the pancakes to cook, make the sauce by combining coconut yogurt, cocoa powder and maple syrup in a bowl until smooth.

 4) Plate up your pancakes, drizzle chocolate yogurt sauce on them and top with blueberries and desiccated coconut. Enjoy!
